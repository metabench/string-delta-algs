// But will also include something saying what delta algorithm is being used.
//  Or what delta format, really.

// formats such as:
//  https://github.com/icflorescu/textdiff version 1
//  format name, and version string as well?
//   or version int. The major version should be the only one that matters?
//   Or minor and middle if it's less than 1.0.0 I suppose.
//    Version could be string or int.

// Would be left there by default.

// Could me make an object extend 'string' even?
//  Being the JSON string representation of the encoded delta.

// Need consistent, performant, easy to use difference finding patch system for compression of similar documents and strings.
//  Likely newer versions of downloaded docs.

// And will have delta alg names, versions too. Always include name, optionally include version.
//  Though could have a default encoding???

// The icflorescu/textdiff/+issue-4-enchanced algorithm seems like a good one to use.
//  Would produce a JS array.
//  Should make for relatively concise diff strings, which can then be compressed alongside other (similar?) diff strings in an
//  array of compressed objects.

// Should work on the compressed objects array storage.
//  Storing a sequence of diffs / delta patches (used for compression) in such an array of compressed objects should be efficient.

// An easy to use delta / diff API looks like it would be useful, and also want to allow for improved non-backwards compatible diffing methods,
//  and being able to identify which specific diffing method is used. Different versions of a module that use a different method could have a different
//  diffing method name string.
